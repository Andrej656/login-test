# Login Test

Login Test is a React application featuring a simple landing page and a user dashboard intended for interacting with Smart Contracts on the Stacks chain to claim NFTs. The primary goal of this project is to explore the interoperability between a React application and a Smart Contract written in Clarity. Additionally, it aims to identify any potential issues, bugs, or areas for improvement in this interaction.

## Overview

The application consists of two main components:
- **Landing Page:** Provides a basic user interface to initiate the login process.
- **User Dashboard:** Offers a simplified dashboard interface for users to interact with and claim NFTs on the Stacks chain.

## Purpose

### Testing Clarity Smart Contracts
The primary objective is to test the integration of Smart Contracts written in Clarity with a React-based frontend application. This includes assessing functionalities related to NFT claims and verifying the seamless interaction between the frontend and the Stacks blockchain.

### Identifying Issues and Improvements
The project aims to identify any potential issues, bugs, or limitations encountered during the interaction between the React app and the Smart Contracts. Additionally, it seeks to highlight areas for improvement, whether in code structure, contract functionality, or user experience.
